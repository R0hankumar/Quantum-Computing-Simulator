# Quantum Computing Simulator

This project is a Quantum Computing Simulator that allows users to experiment with quantum algorithms and explore the principles of quantum mechanics.

## Backend

The backend server is built using Flask and provides an API endpoint for simulating quantum circuits.

## Frontend

The frontend interface allows users to build quantum circuits and visualize quantum states.

## Docker

The application can be containerized using Docker for easy deployment.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository.
2. Build the Docker image: `docker build -t quantum-simulator .`
3. Run the Docker container: `docker run -p 5000:5000 quantum-simulator`
4. Access the simulator at `http://localhost:5000`.
